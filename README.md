# 🌅 Day to Night Image Translation using Pix2Pix GAN

This project implements a **Pix2Pix GAN** model to translate **daytime images into nighttime images**. The model is trained on a manually paired dataset and includes an interactive **Gradio interface** for real-time image translation.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### 1. `Dataset/`
- Contains manually paired day and night images.
- Organized into:
  - `day/` — 75 images taken during the day.
  - `night/` — 75 corresponding images taken at night.

### 2. `output/`
- Contains:
  - `fake_*.png` — 100 images generated by the **U-Net generator** as nighttime translations.
  - `main.ipynb` — The main notebook that contains all code, including:
    - Model architecture (Pix2Pix GAN with U-Net Generator and PatchGAN Discriminator)
    - Training logic
    - Inference on new images
    - Gradio interface setup

### 3. `main.ipynb`
- This Jupyter notebook walks through:
  - Loading and preprocessing the dataset
  - Building the Generator and Discriminator
  - Training the Pix2Pix GAN
  - Generating fake nighttime images
  - Deploying a simple **Gradio interface** for demo usage

### 4. `requirements.txt`
- Contains all required Python libraries to run the project.
